If you are an Ubuntu user that:

* Constantly break their VMs. 
* Have multiple machines with chaotic configurations.
* A bit interested in CTFs and Binary exploitation.

This repo contains a quick installer for basic Binary Exploitation (pwn) and CTF stuff, some of my dotfiles and things that make my Ubuntu machine less miserable.
